"""
The Hot/Cold Game

The user has to try to find a hidden circle using his circle to move around the screen.
The game's objective is to see how many moves it takes you to find a hidden circle
on the screen using another circle to navigate.

The hidden circle (same color as the screen background) will be randomly placed on the screen

The user’s circle will always start in the center of the screen

Allow the user to select the difficulty of the game by controlling the size of the circle
and the distance it moves on each attempt

The user’s circle will be red (hot) when getting closer or blue (cold) when getting further away from the hidden circle

The game has the following key options:
Up, Down, Left, and Right arrows
D = Toggle debug mode (displays the display the hidden circle)
H = Move the user’s circle home position x=0, y=0
R = Reset the game

The game will always display a running total of the number of moves
